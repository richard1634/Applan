# Applan

Hello, welcome to my first dynamic application. Applan is created using python and Django framework in order to help organize my life during this pandemic. I find it hard to organize times and commit myself to any given task; so this app will help me stay focused
on track on the things that matter to me (such as learning new tech, problem code solving, and practicing my hobbies). It will act sort of like a to-do list, but with an added layer of complexity. It will have timers, goals, and reminders designed to help productivity.
Further more, it will display how efficient I am being on any given day.

Supports log ins, and user specific information.
